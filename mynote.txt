he is broken..
he chooses me to heal his heart..
i did the same..
i helped him to get move on..
he shares all his feelings with me..
i am so poor that i can't even understand them..
but i always tried my best to make him feel better..
now we are carrying an unbreakable , unreplacable bond..
now he calls me his bestfriend..
.
.
.
.
.
everything is continuing...
.
.
.
now because of some stupid topic we are ignoring eachother...
but i have trust, i have faith that we can't stay away from eachother that long...
story continues...
.
.
.
.
we are still not talking..
now those misunderstanding got a brutal size.
.
.
continuing the story..
.
day by day everything is getting worst..
he found a new bestfriend.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
and me ?
.
.
.
.
my heart is badly broken now.
for the very first time.
its not love .
i never thought friendship hurts this badly.
don't know that whether it is attachments..
don't know whether i am loosing a hope..
don't know whether it is only me who were so involved.
don't know whether i am emotionally used..
don't know whether he is real..
.
.
but now i can easily understand his feelings during his breakup.
now i can understand all those quotes , he sended me..
now i can feel those lyrics..
now i lost myself for a period of time..
now he is not there , when i needed him the most..
now he is not my bestfriend..
now he is done with me.

.
story continues..
.
i,
badly crying.
badly overthinking.
badly in deep shit.
.
.
i need hope .
now i am all mine.
now i decide to make me as my first priority.
now god is everything for me.
