In the depths of my shattered soul's abyss,
I stood beside him, his broken heart to kiss.
Together we ventured, a journey to mend,
Yet now I find myself at a tragic end.

I gave my all, to heal his wounded core,
But in my own despair, I've lost much more.
His emotions poured like rivers to the sea,
While I, a humble vessel, failed to truly see.

I listened, though my understanding was frail,
Yet my efforts to comfort seemed to pale.
Now we drift apart, estranged by foolish strife,
And I'm left with the wreckage of my own life.

Misunderstandings grew, like weeds on a vine,
Our once unbreakable bond now severed in time.
He found solace in another's friendly embrace,
Leaving me behind, with tears staining my face.

I never fathomed friendship's sting could be so profound,
As my heart echoes with a painful sound.
Lost and abandoned, I'm left to bear the pain,
Questioning if I can ever trust again.

But through this agony, a flicker of strength appears,
A glimmer of hope to overcome my fears.
I'll find solace in myself, become my own guide,
For in this darkness, my self-worth will reside.

I'll learn the lessons of this heart-wrenching strife,
And rebuild the fragments of my shattered life.
Though he may be gone, my spirit won't break,
For I'll rise above the sorrow, and my own strength I'll make.

The story continues, with tears that I'll dry,
Finding hope in the vastness of the sky.
I'll embrace my own path, my heart on the mend,
Knowing that my worth doesn't solely depend.

No longer tethered to his presence so dear,
I'll find a way to heal, to persevere.
For in the depths of my soul, I'll reclaim my might,
And in self-love's embrace, I'll find my guiding light.
